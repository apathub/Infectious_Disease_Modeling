Hello,

this folder contains the Infectious disease project.
This is an example of all the programming approaches I use for the applications I develop during my PhD at UT Austin.
The core of the program is written in c++ 11.
The code is designed using an object oriented philosophy and is highly modular.
A command line user interface is used to walk the user to the different modules.

To compile: go to ./source/Infectious_Desease
For Linux systems (requires g++ compiler)
1) use the makefile (run make Test) to compile all exercises or to remove (make RemoveBin) the binary files
2) then you can run the console user interface to run all the experiemtns (./program)
3) a summary of the results is given at summary.csv files

For Windows systems go to ./source/
I have included a solution for visual studio


Moreover I have a included a file which presents a discussion about the results the program yields (Report.pdf) 


Thanks a lot!
